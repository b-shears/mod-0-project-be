#What do you think the if does to the code under it?
 ##The if statement will either print the code underneath if it is true or it will
 ##not print it if it is not true

#Why does the code under the if need to be indented two spaces?
  ##This is common convention to save space.

#What happens if it isn't indented?
  ## You get the same output. It is covention not syntax.

#Can you put other boolean expressions from exercise 27 iin the if-statement? Try it
 ##I tired greater than or equal to and less than or equal too. It changed the output.

 ##What happnes if you change the intial value for people, cats, dogs?
  ##It changes the output based on what you change those numbers to be.
