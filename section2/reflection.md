## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- I really appreciated the SMART goals for setting specific, measureable, achieveable, relevant, and time-bound goals. Also undestanding that mistakes are critical to learning. When you see mistakes as critical to learning, you won't feel discouraged when you make a mistake.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- Currently I seek out challenges and realized that failure is just an opportunity for growth. I also am not afraid to seek help, and see asking questions as a strength and not a weakenss.
3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

- Conditional statements statements evaluate to true or false. Examples of a conditional statement is using ==, <, <=, ||, etc. in and if, elsif, else statement.

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

- If statements help logically solve problems by determining what is true. If soemthing is not ture, they then move to what else could be true based on the inputs (i.e. variable, string,e etc.)

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

- if, elsif, else, end

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

- By using elsif & else.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

def water_status(minutes)
 
if minutes < 7
 
puts "The water is not boiling yet."

elsif minutes == 7

puts "It's just barely boiling"

elsif minutes == 
puts "It's boiling!"
else
puts "Hot! Hot! Hot!"
end
end
