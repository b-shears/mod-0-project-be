# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
puts name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
statement = "#{name} must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts statement
# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22+2
puts students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22-2
puts students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Bryan"
is_hungry = "feed me now!"
number_of_pets = 1

puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets
puts "#{first_name} says #{is_hungry} & I have #{number_of_pets} pet!"

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.
#I decided to use two strings for the variables first_name & is_hungry because I thought text made sends
#made sense here. I also decided to use an integer for number_of_pets because it made sense.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Jimmy"
is_hungry = "Let me tell you in spanish, No!"
number_of_pets = 242

puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

total_snacks = healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
puts total_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?
