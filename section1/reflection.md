## Section 1 Reflection

###
1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
###
- Sometimes I do ask them too soon. Other times I wait too long. I understand a problem is  easier to solve if it is well defined. And when you have a question it is important to define the question well.

###
2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
``` ruby
puts "Hello World!"
```
###
3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
###
- # The hashtag
###
4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
###
- An integer is a whole number like 42. A float is a number with a decimal like 42.0.
###
5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

```ruby
animal = "zebra"

```
###
6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

``` ruby
puts animal

```
###
7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
###
- Interpolation is the insertion of something of a different nature into something else. So in coding it can be inserting a previously defined variable into a string.
```ruby
puts "#{animal}, a beautiful animal!"
```
###
8. What method is used to get input from a user?
```ruby
gets.chomp
```
###
9. Name and describe two common string methods:
###
-String interpolation - this allows you to combine strings together. You can put code inside the Interpolation

###
-String length - you can get the string length by using the .size method to determine the length of the string
